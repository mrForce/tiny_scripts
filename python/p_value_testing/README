I'm trying to answer a question with a simulation. Should our conception of a "random peptide" be based on the sample, or the target database search?

I'll generate random peptides from a restricted set of amino acids, and call predict-peptide-ions to predict spectra. Construct an MGF file from this, and run a search against a proteome. See what the output is, and the p-values.
